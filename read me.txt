This is a flask application with PostgreSQL.
Here run.py is the starting point of this application.
config.py contains information about database.
On the app folder here it contains model folder. Here is db.py database related codes contains in this page.
 Here we use  function
 get_db_connection() that create connection with config.py.

The overall view is:

app/model/db.py :
Database related works
app/model/routes/role_routes.py:
Routing related tasks and post function related tasks
add/static: for storing css and js
app/templates/: html related files

_init_.py: This page defines a Flask app factory that creates the app and registers the role_bp blueprint for routing.

config.py: Database info

run.py:This runs the Flask app by creating it with create_app() and starting the server in debug mode.

API :

Geocode API :  to get lat and lon from address
Weather metro api: to get weather from lat and lon
Reverse API: to get address from lat and lon

HTML File shows JSON data that is return by POST function. For showing weather information from weather code here we use

Table : tbl_user
Collumns:
